## Known Issues 🐛

### All Critical Issues Resolved ✅
1. ~~Static Web App output references~~ ✅ FIXED
2. ~~Cosmos DB partition_key_paths~~ ✅ FIXED
3. ~~Function App runtime stack~~ ✅ FIXED
4. ~~Health check configuration~~ ✅ FIXED
5. ~~GitHub token permissions~~ ✅ FIXED

### Current Limitations
1. **No Function Code**: Infrastructure ready, code not deployed
2. **No CI/CD**: Manual deployment only at present
3. **Single Environment**: Only dev deployed so far

## Decisions Made 💡

### Architecture Decisions
1. ✅ **Module Strategy**: One module per Azure service type
2. ✅ **Environment Separation**: Directory-based, not workspace-based
3. ✅ **Runtime Configuration**: .NET 8.0 isolated for Functions
4. ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Direct integration for Static Web Apps
5. ✅ **Consumption Tiers**: Cost-optimized for development

### Technical Choices
1. ✅ **Terraform Version**: 1.9.0+ for latest features
2. ✅ **Provider Version**: 4.40.0 (with compatibility fixes)
3. ✅ **State Management**: Local state for now (remote backend ready)
4. ✅ **Security Approach**: Managed identities enabled
5. ✅ **Monitoring**: Application Insights integrated

## Lessons Learned 📚

### Deployment Insights
1. **Validation vs Runtime**: `terraform validate` doesn't catch all errors
2. **Provider Quirks**: Azure provider has specific requirements for null values
3. **Runtime Exclusivity**: Only one function runtime can be specified
4. **Health Check Rules**: Must be null or within valid range (2-10)
5. **GitHub Token Scope**: Needs `workflow` permission for Actions

### Debugging Best Practices
1. **Incremental Fixes**: Fix one error type at a time
2. **Read Error Messages Carefully**: Azure provider gives specific requirements
3. **Use Dynamic Blocks**: Better for conditional attributes
4. **Test Locally First**: Use terraform plan before apply
5. **Document Fixes**: Keep track of what worked
