# PokeData Product Context

## What is PokeData?
A Pokemon card pricing and data application that provides users with card information and pricing data through a modern web interface.

## Business Problem
The application needs to be deployable across multiple environments and Azure tenants to support:
- Development and testing workflows
- Staging environment for pre-production validation
- Production deployment with high availability
- Potential multi-tenant SaaS scenarios
- Enterprise client deployments in isolated subscriptions

## User Personas

### DevOps Engineer (Primary)
- Needs to deploy infrastructure consistently across environments
- Requires automated testing and validation
- Must manage multiple Azure subscriptions and tenants
- Wants visibility into deployment status and costs

### Development Team
- Needs isolated development environments
- Requires quick deployment cycles
- Wants to test features in staging before production
- Needs access to logs and monitoring

### Operations Team
- Requires infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- Needs disaster recovery capabilities
- Must ensure compliance and security
- Wants cost optimization across environments

## Application Architecture

### Frontend (Static Web App)
- React-based single page application
- Hosted on Azure Static Web Apps
- Connected to GitHub repository for CI/CD
- Serves as primary user interface

### Backend (Function App)
- .NET 8.0 Azure Functions
- Serverless compute for API endpoints
- Handles business logic and data processing
- Integrates with Cosmos DB for data persistence

### API Layer (API Management)
- Centralized API gateway
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Provides API documentation and testing
- Routes requests to appropriate backends

### Database (Cosmos DB)
- NoSQL document database
- Stores Pokemon card data and pricing information
- Serverless tier for cost optimization
- Global distribution capability for future scaling

## User Experience Goals
1. **Consistent Deployments**: Same infrastructure code across all environments
2. **Fast Provisioning**: Quick spin-up of new environments
3. **Self-Service**: Teams can deploy their own environments
4. **Visibility**: Clear understanding of what's deployed where
5. **Reliability**: Automated testing prevents broken deployments

## Technical Requirements
- Infrastructure must be version controlled
- Changes must go through review process
- Deployments must be automated
- Resources must be tagged for cost tracking
- Secrets must be stored securely

## Environment Strategy

### Development
- Minimal resources for cost savings
- Frequent deployments allowed
- Relaxed security for easier debugging
- Shared by development team

### Staging
- Production-like configuration
- Used for final testing
- Restricted access
- Performance testing environment

### Production
- High availability configuration
- Strict security controls
- Change management required
- Monitoring and alerting enabled

## Success Metrics
- Deployment frequency increased
- Time to provision new environment reduced
- Infrastructure drift eliminated
- Deployment failures decreased
- Cost visibility improved
