# PokeData Infrastructure as Code Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code portfolio project demonstrating advanced DevOps practices, multi-environment deployments, and modern CI/CD patterns using the PokeData application as a real-world use case.

## Primary Goal
**Build a comprehensive DevOps portfolio project that showcases marketable skills for DevOps and Cloud Engineering positions**, demonstrating proficiency with industry-standard tools, best practices, and enterprise patterns.

## Core Objectives
1. **Demonstrate IaC Mastery**: Advanced Terraform with modules, workspaces, and remote state management
2. **Showcase CI/CD Expertise**: Multi-platform pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
3. **Implement Security Best Practices**: Secret management, SAST/DAST, policy as code, compliance scanning
4. **Display Cost Optimization**: FinOps practices, resource tagging, cost alerts, and reporting
5. **Prove Testing Competency**: Infrastructure testing, performance testing, and automated validation
6. **Exhibit Monitoring & Observability**: Full stack monitoring with dashboards and alerting
7. **Show Enterprise Patterns**: Multi-tenant, multi-environment, blue-green deployments, GitOps

## Existing Infrastructure Components
1. **API Management Service** (maber-apim-test)
   - Consumption tier
   - Central US region
   - System-assigned managed identity

2. **Static Web App** (Pokedata-SWA)
   - Free tier
   - GitHub integration (main branch)
   - Repository: https://github.com/Abernaughty/PokeData

3. **Azure Function App** (pokedata-func)
   - Windows-based
   - .NET 8.0 runtime
   - Consumption plan
   - CORS configured for multiple origins

4. **Cosmos DB** (pokemon-card-pricing-db)
   - Serverless capacity mode
   - SQL API
   - Continuous backup (7 days)
   - Session consistency

## Success Criteria (Portfolio Requirements)
- [ ] **IaC Excellence**: Modular Terraform with 100% parameterization and reusability
- [ ] **Multi-Platform CI/CD**: Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins pipelines
- [ ] **Security Implementation**: Vault integration, RBAC, network isolation, compliance scanning
- [ ] **Cost Management**: Detailed tagging, cost reports, optimization recommendations
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: >80% infrastructure test coverage with Terratest
- [ ] **Professional Documentation**: README, architecture diagrams, runbooks, API docs
- [ ] **Live Demo Environment**: Publicly accessible demo with monitoring dashboard
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Load testing results, SLA achievement, uptime monitoring
- [ ] **Disaster Recovery**: Documented RTO/RPO, backup strategies, failover procedures
